install axios react-router-dom  react-loader-spinner

for authenticated approach we need signature  that needs to be generated in backend

for unatuhetication approach, allow to upload without the need to generate an auheniticataion signature on our backend, we need add upload preset
create preset by clicking upload presets in cloudinary
videos_preset , images_preset
and change the signing mode to unsigned and in assed folder , write the name of folder u want to be created after uploading img or vdo


and write same name in code
   "upload_preset",
      type === "image" ? "images_preset" : "videos_preset"
    );




VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
add in this format for environmental variable

--------------------------------


now on implementing authentication method we need to generate signature in backend
signature, timestamp, api_key and file is required
signature and timestamp we will get from backend

so we ve 2 task in backend
-generating signature
-uploading img and vdo url to mongodb of those image and videos uploaded in cloudinanry


  "type": "module",
we are doing it to write ejs
insta lling cloudinary cors detenv express mongoose nodemon
